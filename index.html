            <div class="letter-content">
                <p>I am writing this letter for you today my love because i want to give you something immortal. Unlike the flowers you are holding right now in your beautiful hands, this is something that you will be able to come back to whenever you need to feel my love for you. These letters that come from the depth of my heart are for you to keep forever my kitten, i sincerly hope they will be able to carry at least the one pourcent of the intensity of my feelings for you my heart and be worthy of you my love.</p>
                
                <p>I know how much you hate killing flowers, my angel, so I hope it will not be too difficult for you to receive these . I brought them with all my love, and only because I wanted to give you something beautiful today, something worthy of you, to remind you how much i care about you.</p>
            
                <p>I remember when I first met you, I was so eager to learn everything about you, that i kept everything you said to me in my note App on my phone, to read them again and again. With every little thing I discovered, I was falling deeper under your spell. Everything you told me you loved instantly became the most beautiful thing in the world to me. It felt like anything that carried your love must be the purest. Anything you chose became sacred. And as i learned more things, the universe reorganized itself in two categories for me: things loved by my Ioli, and things that werenâ€™t. And everything you loved found a little special place in my heart, right next to you.</p>
            
                <p>One day, you told me that flowers have families, that they deserve to live too. I had never heard anyone say that before. And in that moment, I fell even more in love with you. And I fell in love with flowers too. I had never paid attention to them before, but nowâ€¦ now they feel like little creatures that carry the softest, purest feeling on this earth: my Iolitatâ€™s love. I started looking for them everytime i went outside, little colorful spots in the middle of the boring grass, like sprinkles of your love scattered across the blankness of my life. I liked to imagine you left them there for me, like signs, like traces of your magic, and you found a way to be with me everywhere we couldnâ€™t be together.</p>
            
                <p>I chose sunflowers today, because when you told me they were one of your favorite flowers, you said they make you smile every time you see them. So today, I wanted to make the sun shine a little bit brighter, I know it's already June, but I I love the sun more when itâ€™s glowing with your beauty. And if Iâ€™m lucky, maybe I will be able to steal another smile from you with this letter too my princess ;)</p>
            
                <p>I also picked sunflowers out of all your favorite flowers because sunflowers carry the meaning of joy and light, and when I look at them,  I canâ€™t help but think of the warmth you brought into my life the moment you entered it. They feel like little mirrors of your spirit. They represent you to me. And I love them, almost as much as I love the one they remind me of.</p>
            
                <p>I know that today Iâ€™m giving you flowers that were cut and I know that goes against something you believe in. But I still wanted you to receive them, because even though I know it contradicts what you believe, I couldnâ€™t help but want to see something beautiful in your hands today. I imagine them whispering their last breath to you, carrying all the love i canâ€™t express for you. These flowers are blooming one last time, just for you.</p>

                <p>I love you so much my heaven, thank you for bringing sun into my life, i love you forever</p>
